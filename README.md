# MITM DETECTOR

This is a simple ARP Spoofing Detector script developed in Python using the Scapy and Colorama libraries. It aims to identify ARP spoofing attacks in your local network by continuously monitoring ARP traffic and comparing MAC addresses.



## Features

- Network Scanning: Periodically updates IP-MAC mappings by scanning the network.
- ARP Monitoring: Continuously monitors ARP packets to detect MAC address discrepancies.
- Real-Time Alerts: Notifies the user of potential ARP spoofing attacks with details on real and fake MAC addresses.
